App 1: Book App
What: An app which includes a list of books
and their description and author. Users are able to make an account and read other users comments about the book.

Who: The audience here is people who enjoy reading books and wish to share their views on whether the book was good or bad: their overall thoughts on it.

Why: We are building this app to create a community for those who wish to see others people's perspective of a book and for the user to write their own perspective (share their thoughts and opinions about the book).

Challenges: Some challenges might include creating a varitey of users interactions with each other. Maybe adding a comment to someone else's comment.

**Fitness App**
What: This app creates a community for those who enjoy working out and it helps the user track their workouts.

Who: The audience here would be those who are already in training or those who are seeking where to start off their fitness lifestyle.

Why: This app will help build a community in where people who already have their training down can help those who are seeking help into their fitness journey.

Challenges: Challenges here would be creating tools to help keep track of the users workouts and goals. Also helping the user interact with others in the community.

Book app brain storm 

get book api 
use api information to build a list 
users can login and rate or comment on a book
users can login and their comments or post can be read
select a book through the API instead of an image like the Bereal app and comment on it. 
use new york time API for books 

app will be three tabs

1 page for user acount/ with access to past post up to 10
2 page for book list API
3 would be for comments and post view from all users at least 10
